# ðŸŽ® Tic-Tac-Toe AI Comparison (Minimax vs Alpha-Beta Pruning)

Tic-Tac-Toe game using Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning AI. Human plays against both AIs one by one and performance is compared at the end.

- **Standard Minimax Algorithm**
- **Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning Optimization**

## ðŸ§  What It Does

- Allows a human to play two games:
  1. First against a Standard Minimax AI
  2. Then against an Alpha-Beta Pruned AI

- After each AI move, it shows:
  - The move selected
  - Time taken
  - Number of nodes explored

- After both games, it compares:
  - Total time taken by each AI
  - Total number of nodes explored
  - Efficiency difference
